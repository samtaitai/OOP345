>>why was necessary to use binary files in this workshop and how did you use them
It was not necessary because data was simple texts. There's not much risk of losing data for simple texts. 
That's how I used them: 
ofstream outbinfile(file, ios::binary);
outbinfile.write(text, nbytes);

ifstream inbinfile(file, ios::binary);
inbinfile.read(text, nbytes);

>>why would be important to bind a function to its arguments, and how was it useful in this workshop
It allows you to bind specific arguments to a function and generate a new callable object.
As you put different values to placeholders(_1, _2, _3), you could generate multi tasks.

auto c1 = bind(converter, placeholders::_1, placeholders::_2, placeholders::_3, Cryptor());
thread t1(c1, text, key, nbytes);

>>the advantages of using multiple threads, and how did you accomplished multi-threading in this workshop
It makes it faster. 
Below is what I've tried to do multi-threading.  

const int chunk = nbytes / 4;
		const int crumb = nbytes % 4;

		//Cryptor() is bound
		auto c = bind(converter, placeholders::_1, placeholders::_2, placeholders::_3, Cryptor());

		//bound one is omitted
		thread t1(c, text, key, chunk);
		thread t2(c, text+chunk, key, chunk);
		thread t3(c, text+2*chunk, key, chunk);
		thread t4(c, text+3*chunk, key, chunk+crumb);

		t1.join();
		t2.join();
		t3.join();
		t4.join();
